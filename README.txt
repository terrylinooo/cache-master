Notice:

Before you install and use this plugin, please read the following notices carefully.

- Logged-in users will not trigger the caching processes.
- A debug message will be attached to the end of the page source code. `<!-- This page is cached by Cache Master plugin. //-->`. This is for debugging purpose only, to let us know that the page is caching. This message can be disabled in `Settings` page.

If you find your website doesn't work with Cache Master, please report an issue on GitHub and list all plugins installed on your website. I'll find out the problem and fix it.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/cache-master` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Go to the Cache Master menu in Plugins and set your options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Should I disable other cache plugins? =

Cache Master caches full webpages to static HTML files so that it is better to disable other similar cache plugins that do the same thing. It's okay to work with the object cache plugin together.

= How do I know whether or not the caching is working? =

Things to be aware of, the logged-in users will not trigger the caching processes. Please use incognito mode or another browser to revisit the same webpage, and then you can check the cache status in one of the following ways:

* View the source code of the webpage to check the debug message as the screenshot (L)
* Turn on the benchmark information in the footer section, as the screenshot (K), and you can see the cache status there.

If there is no debug message in the source code or the cache status always shows No, it is probably a plugin conflicting with Cache Master, causing it not working.
